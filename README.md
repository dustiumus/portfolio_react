Welcome to My Portfolio Re-do! 

I am still on the learning train so I decided to re-make and finally finish a portfolio and since I mainly code in Python, 
I decided to try a project with Js and more importantly using the React framework to build such a project. 

Thanks for taking a moment to look! I will continue to build side projects and learn as much as I can as I continue my Job Search and continue to work on personal projects as much as I can!
